# Define CAC Model Directive (Advanced)

## Purpose
Establish a **single, authoritative definition of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** that is:
- Conservative
- Fully loaded
- Channel-comparable
- Compatible with a **12:1 or greater LTV:CAC requirement**

This directive answers:

> **What does it actually cost — in cash and time — to acquire one real customer?**

All acquisition decisions must use **this definition only**.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principle

> **If a cost exists because customers are acquired, it is CAC — even if it feels indirect.**

Under-counted CAC creates the illusion of growth while destroying profit.

---

## CAC Model Selection (Mandatory)

The agent must use **Model A** by default.

### **Model A — Fully Loaded, Contribution-Compatible CAC (REQUIRED)**

\[
\text{CAC} =
\frac{\text{Total Acquisition Costs for Period}}{\text{New Customers Acquired in Period}}
\]

Where acquisition costs include **all costs that scale with customer acquisition**.

---

## Required Inputs (All Mandatory)

The agent must request missing inputs.

### Paid Costs
- Ad spend (by channel)
- Creative production (amortized)
- Agency / freelancer fees (amortized)
- Sponsorships, promotions

### Owned / Earned Costs (Allocated)
- Email platform fees (allocated)
- Website hosting (allocated)
- Content production time (valued, not free)
- Referral incentives

### Labor Costs (Mandatory)
- Founder acquisition time (hours × hourly rate)
- Sales / DM / inquiry handling time
- Pre-sale support time

> “I don’t pay myself yet” is not allowed.  
> Founder time must be costed at **replacement value**.

---

## CAC Time Horizon Rules

### Default Measurement Window
- **30 days** rolling window

### Acceptable Alternatives
- Per launch / per drop
- Per campaign (if clearly bounded)

The window must:
- Capture spend **before** conversion
- Attribute customers conservatively

---

## Execution Steps (Sequential)

### Step 1: Identify Acquisition Activities

List every activity that exists **solely to generate customers**, including:
- Ads
- Content
- Outreach
- Partnerships
- Drops / launches
- Brand storytelling (if demand-driven)

If an activity would stop if you stopped selling — it is acquisition.

---

### Step 2: Assign Costs (Fully Loaded)

For each activity:
- Assign direct cash costs
- Assign time costs (hours × rate)
- Amortize shared costs proportionally

Rules:
- Time costs are never zero
- Uncertain costs are rounded **up**

---

### Step 3: Attribute Customers Conservatively

Rules:
- Only count **new customers**
- Returning customers do NOT reduce CAC
- Multi-touch attribution defaults to **last meaningful action**

If attribution is unclear:
- CAC must be treated as **higher**, not lower

---

### Step 4: Calculate Blended CAC

\[
\text{Blended CAC} =
\frac{\text{Total Acquisition Costs}}{\text{New Customers}}
\]

Also calculate:
- CAC by channel
- CAC by campaign (if applicable)

---

### Step 5: Apply Risk Buffer (Planning Stage)

Planning-stage CAC must include a buffer:

\[
\text{Usable CAC} = \text{Calculated CAC} \times 1.20
\]

This accounts for:
- Tracking errors
- Over-optimism
- Hidden labor
